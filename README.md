Simplified Tetris 1.0

Welcome to my final project for Code In Place 2020!

While watching the ‘move_rectangle’ lecture, I wanted to attempt to make a square fall and land on the bottom of the canvas. “Hey, that looks like Tetris!”. Knowing that the complete capabilities of Tetris is out of the scope of my programming knowledge, I still decided to try to make a simplified version. I managed to work in small steps, and lots of breaks, to achieve the following functionalities:

    Tetromino falls until it reaches an obstacle
    Tetromino can rotate
    Detects the end of the game

The following functionalities are goals for Simplified Tetris 2.0:

    Make completed rows disappear
    Check for ‘legal’ moves
    Add score
    Add instant drop
    Add preview next piece
    Add music

Thank you to professors Chris Piech and Mehran Sahami and the hundreds of Code in Place staff and Section Leaders for a once in a lifetime experience. 

Thank you for watching!
